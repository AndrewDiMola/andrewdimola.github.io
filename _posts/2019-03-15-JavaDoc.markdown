title:  "An example JavaDoc"
---
This document demonstrates how a Java programmer would call a Java method named findNeedles. 
I generated it using Java SE 11 with a tool called javadoc. 
Basically, at runtime, javadoc searches for various tags that a developer or technical writer embeds in Java source code, then it uses those tags to dynamically generate documentation. 
I also included instructions for how the method works on the page.

To view this JavaDoc, see <a href="/samples/haystack.pdf">the PDF below</a>.

If you'd like to see more, <a href="/samples/findNeedles-source-code.txt">read the source code</a>.
