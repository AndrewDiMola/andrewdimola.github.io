title:  "Choosing between SOAP and REST web services"
---
When designing a web service, spend time considering both the end user and the service itself.
For example, how many requests do you expect the service to handle on an average day? A
RESTful web service–that is, a service that conforms to the REST architectural style–tends to use
less bandwidth and memory; however, a service that uses the SOAP protocol may be better
suited for an enterprise application.

one architectural style over the other, <a href="/samples/SOAP-and-REST.pdf">open the PDF</a>.
