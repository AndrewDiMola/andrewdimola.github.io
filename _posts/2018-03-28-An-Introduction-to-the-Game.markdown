## Base Class Plus

[Base Class Plus](https://github.com/AndrewDiMola/Base-Class-Plus) is a tactical role-playing game (TRPG) that can (eventually) be played in standalone instances. My end goal is to have this game be playable Ã  la the Jackbox model, where a phone, tablet, laptop, or other web-enabled device is used as a controller.

Back when I was younger, I was really into TRPGs like Final Fantasy Advance (and, when I became older, Final Fantasy Tactics), and was often frustrated because to play that style game with a friend, I would need to 1) convince them to buy the game, 2) convince them to play the game long enough to unlock multiplayer, and, finally, 3) convince them to level up their characters at a rate similar to my own. So, yeah, I never really had a chance to play this style of game in multiplayer mode. That's why the Jackbox-style multiplayer method is so appealing: anyone can play anywhere, so long as their device is charged and they actually want to play.

As stated earlier, Base Class Plus can (eventually) be played in standalone instances. Sounds annoyingly technical, right? Right. But all I'm really saying here is that (in-game) experience and levels don't exist: every player starts out with the same character options and character abilities as their opponent. Then, in game, players can choose to "level up" their "base classes" into "advanced classes" with the use of a temple, or something like that. But at the same time, if the player just wants to blindly hobo-rush their opponent into submission, they can just do that too. Other RPG elements like weapons and equipment will be added in the form of chests on the battlefield. The idea here being that if a player walks over a chest, they'll auto-equip whatever equipment they walked over, but only for the duration of the game instance.

Here's an example of what I'm building towards using my super-awesome MS Paint skills and some sprites borrowed from Final Fantasy I (Square Enix Co., Ltd.). Note: these sprites will not be used in the final product, and are only used for demonstration purposes.
