title:  "Documenting an example API with Swagger"

Before I get into this sample, I figured it would be useful to explain two concepts laid out in the title of this page. If you're familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip ahead; if you're unfamiliar, read my explanations below!

* **What's an API?** In my experience, writers and other tech folk tend to say that API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and leave it at that. But that's not really helpful. And it feels... overwhelmingly ambiguous. In simpler terms, an API is a set of rules (stick with me) that define how two pieces of software (like your browser and a server, or your phone and a server) talk with one another. It's how they send information back and forth. So, for example, if I'm building a phone application that connects with Twitter, I can use [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html) to send and receive information between the phone application and Twitter. In practical terms, I can "call" (i.e., send a request to) the API for a user's Twitter followers; or send a request for the most recent tweets from those followers; or, if a user wants to send a tweet from the phone application itself, I can use the API to post a tweet from that user, so long as they have given explicit permission and authorization for my phone application to do so on their behalf.
