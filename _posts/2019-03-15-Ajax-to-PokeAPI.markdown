title:  "Creating AJAX requests with the PokéAPI"
---
The PokéAPI is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

I wrote this document for developers who don't have significant experience working with APIs. The writing is my own, with the exception of content I ported from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/about.html">their About page</a>. 
Additionally, for the document, I modified an existing CodePen sample by Brian Holt. To view Brian’s code, see <a href="https://codepen.io/btholt/pen/FArdh">jQuery AJAX Example</a>.

To learn how to create a request with this API, see <a href="/samples/AJAX-to-PokeApi.pdf">the PDF below</a>.
